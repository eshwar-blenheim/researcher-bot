"Artificial Intelligence","A Knowledge-Oriented Approach to Enhance Integration and Communicability in the Polkadot Ecosystem","The Polkadot ecosystem is a disruptive and highly complex multi-chain architecture that poses challenges in terms of data analysis and communicability. Currently, there is a lack of standardized and holistic approaches to retrieve and analyze data across parachains and applications, making it difficult for general users and developers to access ecosystem data consistently. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that includes a domain ontology called POnto (a Polkadot Ontology) to address these challenges. POnto provides a structured representation of the ecosystem's concepts and relationships, enabling a formal understanding of the platform. The proposed knowledge-oriented approach enhances integration and communicability, enabling a wider range of users to participate in the ecosystem and facilitating the development of AI-based applications. The paper presents a case study methodology to validate the proposed framework, which includes expert feedback and insights from the Polkadot community. The POnto ontology and the roadmap for a query engine based on a Controlled Natural Language using the ontology, provide valuable contributions to the growth and adoption of the Polkadot ecosystem in heterogeneous socio-technical environments."
"Artificial Intelligence","Beneficent Intelligence: A Capability Approach to Modeling Benefit, Assistance, and Associated Moral Failures through AI Systems","The prevailing discourse around AI ethics lacks the language and formalism necessary to capture the diverse ethical concerns that emerge when AI systems interact with individuals. Drawing on Sen and Nussbaum's capability approach, we present a framework formalizing a network of ethical concepts and entitlements necessary for AI systems to confer meaningful benefit or assistance to stakeholders. Such systems enhance stakeholders' ability to advance their life plans and well-being while upholding their fundamental rights. We characterize two necessary conditions for morally permissible interactions between AI systems and those impacted by their functioning, and two sufficient conditions for realizing the ideal of meaningful benefit. We then contrast this ideal with several salient failure modes, namely, forms of social interactions that constitute unjustified paternalism, coercion, deception, exploitation and domination. The proliferation of incidents involving AI in high-stakes domains underscores the gravity of these issues and the imperative to take an ethics-led approach to AI systems from their inception."
"Artificial Intelligence","Scaling Data Science Solutions with Semantics and Machine Learning: Bosch Case","Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies unlock unprecedented amount of data from factory production, posing big data challenges in volume and variety. In that context, distributed computing solutions such as cloud systems are leveraged to parallelise the data processing and reduce computation time. As the cloud systems become increasingly popular, there is increased demand that more users that were originally not cloud experts (such as data scientists, domain experts) deploy their solutions on the cloud systems. However, it is non-trivial to address both the high demand for cloud system users and the excessive time required to train them. To this end, we propose SemCloud, a semantics-enhanced cloud system, that couples cloud system with semantic technologies and machine learning. SemCloud relies on domain ontologies and mappings for data integration, and parallelises the semantic data integration and data analysis on distributed computing nodes. Furthermore, SemCloud adopts adaptive Datalog rules and machine learning for automated resource configuration, allowing non-cloud experts to use the cloud system. The system has been evaluated in industrial use case with millions of data, thousands of repeated runs, and domain users, showing promising results."
"Artificial Intelligence","Literal-Aware Knowledge Graph Embedding for Welding Quality Monitoring: A Bosch Case","Recently there has been a series of studies in knowledge graph embedding (KGE), which attempts to learn the embeddings of the entities and relations as numerical vectors and mathematical mappings via machine learning (ML). However, there has been limited research that applies KGE for industrial problems in manufacturing. This paper investigates whether and to what extent KGE can be used for an important problem: quality monitoring for welding in manufacturing industry, which is an impactful process accounting for production of millions of cars annually. The work is in line with Bosch research of data-driven solutions that intends to replace the traditional way of destroying cars, which is extremely costly and produces waste. The paper tackles two very challenging questions simultaneously: how large the welding spot diameter is; and to which car body the welded spot belongs to. The problem setting is difficult for traditional ML because there exist a high number of car bodies that should be assigned as class labels. We formulate the problem as link prediction, and experimented popular KGE methods on real industry data, with consideration of literals. Our results reveal both limitations and promising aspects of adapted KGE methods."
"Artificial Intelligence","Arithmetic with Language Models: from Memorization to Computation","A better understanding of the emergent computation and problem-solving capabilities of recent large language models is of paramount importance to further improve them and broaden their applicability. This work investigates how a language model, trained to predict the next token, can perform arithmetic computations generalizing beyond training data. Binary addition and multiplication constitute a good testbed for this purpose, since they require a very small vocabulary and exhibit relevant input/output discontinuities making smooth input interpolation ineffective for novel data. We successfully trained a light language model to learn these tasks and ran a number of experiments to investigate the extrapolation capabilities and internal information processing. Our findings support the hypotheses that the language model works as an Encoding-Regression-Decoding machine where the computation takes place in the value space once the input token representation is mapped to an appropriate internal representation.

"Artificial Intelligence","Exploring the psychology of GPT-4's Moral and Legal Reasoning","Large language models have been used as the foundation of highly sophisticated artificial intelligences, capable of delivering human-like responses to probes about legal and moral issues. However, these models are unreliable guides to their own inner workings, and even the engineering teams behind their creation are unable to explain exactly how they came to develop all of the capabilities they currently have. The emerging field of machine psychology seeks to gain insight into the processes and concepts that these models possess. In this paper, we employ the methods of psychology to probe into GPT-4's moral and legal reasoning. More specifically, we investigate the similarities and differences between GPT-4 and humans when it comes to intentionality ascriptions, judgments about causation, the morality of deception, moral foundations, the impact of moral luck on legal judgments, the concept of consent, and rule violation judgments. We find high correlations between human and AI responses, but also several significant systematic differences between them. We conclude with a discussion of the philosophical implications of our findings."
"Artificial Intelligence","Flows: Building Blocks of Reasoning and Collaborating AI","Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have produced highly capable and controllable systems. This creates unprecedented opportunities for structured reasoning as well as collaboration among multiple AI systems and humans. To fully realize this potential, it is essential to develop a principled way of designing and studying such structured interactions. For this purpose, we introduce the conceptual framework of Flows: a systematic approach to modeling complex interactions. Flows are self-contained building blocks of computation, with an isolated state, communicating through a standardized message-based interface. This modular design allows Flows to be recursively composed into arbitrarily nested interactions, with a substantial reduction of complexity. Crucially, any interaction can be implemented using this framework, including prior work on AI--AI and human--AI interactions, prompt engineering schemes, and tool augmentation. We demonstrate the potential of Flows on the task of competitive coding, a challenging task on which even GPT-4 struggles. Our results suggest that structured reasoning and collaboration substantially improve generalization, with AI-only Flows adding +21 and human--AI Flows adding +54 absolute points in terms of solve rate. To support rapid and rigorous research, we introduce the aiFlows library. The library comes with a repository of Flows that can be easily used, extended, and composed into novel, more complex Flows. 
The aiFlows library is available at https://github.com/epfl-dlab/aiflows. Data and Flows for reproducing our experiments are available at https://github.com/epfl-dlab/cc_flows."
"Artificial Intelligence","A Bibliographic Study on Artificial Intelligence Research: Global Panorama and Indian Appearance","The present study identifies and assesses the bibliographic trend in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research for the years 2015-2020 using the science mapping method of bibliometric study. The required data has been collected from the Scopus database. To make the collected data analysis-ready, essential data transformation was performed manually and with the help of a tool viz. OpenRefine. For determining the trend and performing the mapping techniques, top five open access and commercial journals of AI have been chosen based on their citescore driven ranking. The work includes 6880 articles published in the specified period for analysis. The trend is based on Country-wise publications, year-wise publications, topical terms in AI, top-cited articles, prominent authors, major institutions, involvement of industries in AI and Indian appearance. The results show that compared to open access journals; commercial journals have a higher citescore and number of articles published over the years. Additionally, IEEE is the prominent publisher which publishes 84% of the top-cited publications. Further, China and the United States are the major contributors to literature in the AI domain. The study reveals that neural networks and deep learning are the major topics included in top AI research publications. Recently, not only public institutions but also private bodies are investing their resources in AI research. The study also investigates the relative position of Indian researchers in terms of AI research. Present work helps in understanding the initial development, current stand and future direction of AI."
"Artificial Intelligence","Approximate Model-Based Shielding for Safe Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for solving complex tasks in a variety of domains. However, applying RL to safety-critical systems in the real-world is not easy as many algorithms are sample-inefficient and maximising the standard RL objective comes with no guarantees on worst-case performance. In this paper we propose approximate model-based shielding (AMBS), a principled look-ahead shielding algorithm for verifying the performance of learned RL policies w.r.t. a set of given safety constraints. Our algorithm differs from other shielding approaches in that it does not require prior knowledge of the safety-relevant dynamics of the system. We provide a strong theoretical justification for AMBS and demonstrate superior performance to other safety-aware approaches on a set of Atari games with state-dependent safety-labels."
"Mathematics","Signed double Roman domination on cubic graphs","The signed double Roman domination problem is a combinatorial optimization problem on a graph asking to assign a label from {±1,2,3} to each vertex feasibly, such that the total sum of assigned labels is minimized. Here feasibility is given whenever (i) vertices labeled ±1 have at least one neighbor with label in {2,3}; (ii) each vertex labeled −1 has one 3-labeled neighbor or at least two 2-labeled neighbors; and (iii) the sum of labels over the closed neighborhood of any vertex is positive. The cumulative weight of an optimal labeling is called signed double Roman domination number (SDRDN). In this work, we first consider the problem on general cubic graphs of order n for which we present a sharp n/2+Θ(1) lower bound for the SDRDN by means of the discharging method. Moreover, we derive a new best upper bound. Observing that we are often able to minimize the SDRDN over the class of cubic graphs of a fixed order, we then study in this context generalized Petersen graphs for independent interest, for which we propose a constraint programming guided proof. We then use these insights to determine the SDRDNs of subcubic 2×m grid graphs, among other results."
"Mathematics","Balanced-chromatic number and Hadwiger-like conjectures","Motivated by different characterizations of planar graphs and the 4-Color Theorem, several structural results concerning graphs of high chromatic number have been obtained. Toward strengthening some of these results, we consider the \emph{balanced chromatic number}, χb(Ĝ), of a signed graph Ĝ. This is the minimum number of parts into which the vertices of a signed graph can be partitioned so that none of the parts induces a negative cycle. This extends the notion of the chromatic number of a graph since χ(G)=χb(G̃), where G̃ denotes the signed graph obtained from~G by replacing each edge with a pair of (parallel) positive and negative edges. We introduce a signed version of Hadwiger's conjecture as follows. 
Conjecture: If a signed graph Ĝ has no negative loop and no Kt~-minor, then its balanced chromatic number is at most t−1. 
We prove that this conjecture is, in fact, equivalent to Hadwiger's conjecture and show its relation to the Odd Hadwiger Conjecture. 
Motivated by these results, we also consider the relation between subdivisions and balanced chromatic number. We prove that if (G,σ) has no negative loop and no Kt~-subdivision, then it admits a balanced 792t2-coloring. This qualitatively generalizes a result of Kawarabayashi (2013) on totally odd subdivisions."
"Mathematics","Permutation and local permutation polynomial of maximum degree","Subjects: Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
Let Fq be the finite field with q elements and Fq[x1,…,xn] the ring of polynomials in n variables over Fq. In this paper we consider permutation polynomials and local permutation polynomials over Fq[x1,…,xn], which define interesting generalizations of permutations over finite fields. We are able to construct permutation polynomials in Fq[x1,…,xn] of maximum degree n(q−1)−1 and local permutation polynomials in Fq[x1,…,xn] of maximum degree n(q−2) when q>3, extending previous results."

"Machine Learning","Recent advancement in Disease Diagnostic using machine learning: Systematic survey of decades, comparisons, and challenges","Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), a vibrant medical imaging research field, is expanding quickly. Because errors in medical diagnostic systems might lead to seriously misleading medical treatments, major efforts have been made in recent years to improve computer-aided diagnostics applications. The use of machine learning in computer-aided diagnosis is crucial. A simple equation may result in a false indication of items like organs. Therefore, learning from examples is a vital component of pattern recognition. Pattern recognition and machine learning in the biomedical area promise to increase the precision of disease detection and diagnosis. They also support the decision-making process's objectivity. Machine learning provides a practical method for creating elegant and autonomous algorithms to analyze high-dimensional and multimodal bio-medical data. This review article examines machine-learning algorithms for detecting diseases, including hepatitis, diabetes, liver disease, dengue fever, and heart disease. It draws attention to the collection of machine learning techniques and algorithms employed in studying conditions and the ensuing decision-making process."
"Machine Learning","Compressed and distributed least-squares regression: convergence rates with applications to Federated Learning","In this paper, we investigate the impact of compression on stochastic gradient algorithms for machine learning, a technique widely used in distributed and federated learning. We underline differences in terms of convergence rates between several unbiased compression operators, that all satisfy the same condition on their variance, thus going beyond the classical worst-case analysis. To do so, we focus on the case of least-squares regression (LSR) and analyze a general stochastic approximation algorithm for minimizing quadratic functions relying on a random field. We consider weak assumptions on the random field, tailored to the analysis (specifically, expected H\""older regularity), and on the noise covariance, enabling the analysis of various randomizing mechanisms, including compression. We then extend our results to the case of federated learning. 
More formally, we highlight the impact on the convergence of the covariance ℭania of the additive noise induced by the algorithm. We demonstrate despite the non-regularity of the stochastic field, that the limit variance term scales with Tr(ℭaniaH−1)/K (where H is the Hessian of the optimization problem and K the number of iterations) generalizing the rate for the vanilla LSR case where it is σ2Tr(HH−1)/K=σ2d/K (Bach and Moulines, 2013). Then, we analyze the dependency of ℭania on the compression strategy and ultimately its impact on convergence, first in the centralized case, then in two heterogeneous FL frameworks."
"Machine Learning","Regularization, early-stopping and dreaming: a Hopfield-like setup to address generalization and overfitting","In this work we approach attractor neural networks from a machine learning perspective: we look for optimal network parameters by applying a gradient descent over a regularized loss function. Within this framework, the optimal neuron-interaction matrices turn out to be a class of matrices which correspond to Hebbian kernels revised by iteratively applying some unlearning protocols. Remarkably, the number of unlearning steps is proved to be related to the regularization hyperparameters of the loss function and to the training time. Thus, we can design strategies to avoid overfitting that are formulated in terms of the algebraic properties of the interaction matrix, or, equivalently, in terms of regularization tuning and early-stopping strategies. The generalization capabilities of these attractor networks are also investigated: analytical results are obtained for random synthetic datasets, next, the emerging picture is corroborated by numerical experiments that highlight the existence of several regimes (i.e., overfitting, failure and success) as the dataset parameters are varied"
"Machine Learning","Price-Aware Deep Learning for Electricity Markets","While deep learning gradually penetrates operational planning, its inherent prediction errors may significantly affect electricity prices. This letter examines how prediction errors propagate into electricity prices, revealing notable pricing errors and their spatial disparity in congested power systems. To improve fairness, we propose to embed electricity market-clearing optimization as a deep learning layer. Differentiating through this layer allows for balancing between prediction and pricing errors, as oppose to minimizing prediction errors alone. This layer implicitly optimizes fairness and controls the spatial distribution of price errors across the system. We showcase the price-aware deep learning in the nexus of wind power forecasting and short-term electricity market clearing."
"Machine Learning","Novel Physics-Based Machine-Learning Models for Indoor Air Quality Approximations","Cost-effective sensors are capable of real-time capturing a variety of air quality-related modalities from different pollutant concentrations to indoor/outdoor humidity and temperature. Machine learning (ML) models are capable of performing air-quality ""ahead-of-time"" approximations. Undoubtedly, accurate indoor air quality approximation significantly helps provide a healthy indoor environment, optimize associated energy consumption, and offer human comfort. However, it is crucial to design an ML architecture to capture the domain knowledge, so-called problem physics. In this study, we propose six novel physics-based ML models for accurate indoor pollutant concentration approximations. The proposed models include an adroit combination of state-space concepts in physics, Gated Recurrent Units, and Decomposition techniques. The proposed models were illustrated using data collected from five offices in a commercial building in California. The proposed models are shown to be less complex, computationally more efficient, and more accurate than similar state-of-the-art transformer-based models. The superiority of the proposed models is due to their relatively light architecture (computational efficiency) and, more importantly, their ability to capture the underlying highly nonlinear patterns embedded in the often contaminated sensor-collected indoor air quality temporal data."
